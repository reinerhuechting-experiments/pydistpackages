# Regular python package 3

A regular python package with two modules and a non empty `__init__.py`.

The `__init__.py` of this package exposes the `foo()` functions
from its two modules.
These can be imported without specifying the modules in this package.
There also is a `bar()` function in `module2`.
This is accessible, but must be imported the "traditional" way.
