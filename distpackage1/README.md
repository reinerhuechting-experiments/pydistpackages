# Distribution Package 1

This directory contains several python packages that are distributed as
a single distribution package. Installing this distribution package will provide
all packages contained in this directory.

## Entry point

This distribution package also defines one of
the `foo()` functions as its entry point.
Thus, `foo()` can be directly called from the command
line, in this example as `m1foo`.
